# Weather App using JavaFX
This simple app was created using JavaFX and in here the weather API is used in order to get the weather data of a particular area. Below are some screenshot of the app that I created. If any person is interested to know how I created it they can contact me through my email.

>If you search cities or countries containing spaces then it will cause error as the API doesn't support search with spaces. You should avoid it.

>For example: (Sri Lanka, United States), these searches will cause errors
